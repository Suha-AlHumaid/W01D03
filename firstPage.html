        <h2>Coocking</h2>
        <p>
          I like to cook a good food and try new recipes from around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy cooking because it keeps me happy in my life. Whenever I feel
          sad or upset, cooking ease that for me in a big way.

        <h2>Walking</h2>
        <p>
          I like walking, especially taking random walks with no destination in
          mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          I walk every day at least 30 minutes.It is relaxing and brings out the
          positive vibes.
